### The new lib's will be usefully in more wider range -!

For ex) Simple personal blog server (in My starting org.plan too)

But speed was slowly yet. (About ~5KB/s)

If you wanna slightly faster version,   
Using mpy-cross compiled library of the above mpy_lib_cpython-6.3.0 folder

Speed update stretch goal will see next release~!
