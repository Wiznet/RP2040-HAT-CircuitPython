# How to Test MQTT Publish Example

![][link-mqtt]

![][link-mqtt_0]

## Step 1: Prepare Software

> The following serial terminal program is required for **MQTT Publish** test, download and install from below links.

### &#10004;[**Tera Term**][link-tera_term]  or  &#10004; [**Mosquitto**][link-mosquitto]



## Step 2: Prepare hardware

1. Combine WIZnet Ethernet HAT with Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Connect ethernet cable to Ethernet HAT ethernet port.
3. Connect Raspberry Pi Pico to desktop or laptop using 5 pin micro USB cable.



If you use W5100S-EVB-Pico, you can skip '1. Combine...'



## Step 3: Setup MQTT Publish Example

To test the **MQTT Publish example**, minor settings shall be done in code.

1. Setup SPI and Reset pin.

```python
##SPI0
SPI0_SCK = board.GP18
SPI0_TX = board.GP19
SPI0_RX = board.GP16
SPI0_CSn = board.GP17

##reset
W5x00_RSTn = board.GP20
```

2. Initialize ethernet interface with DHCP.

```python
eth = WIZNET5K(spi_bus, cs, is_dhcp=True, mac=MY_MAC, debug=False)
```

3. In the MQTT configuration, the broker IP address is the IP of your desktop.

```python
# Set up a MiniMQTT Client
# NOTE: We'll need to connect insecurely for ethernet configurations.
mqtt_client = MQTT.MQTT(
    broker="192.168.1.11",  #setup your PC IP address.
    username="rpi-pico",       
    password="wiznet",      
    is_ssl=False,
    socket_pool=None,
    ssl_context=None,
    keep_alive=60,
)
```

4. going to use MQTT Publish.

```python
###MQTT Publisher Run###
while True:
    #mqtt_client.loop()

    #send a new message
    mqtt_client.publish(mqtt_topic, text)

    time.sleep(1)

#Disconnected
print("Disconnecting from %s" % mqtt_client.broker)
mqtt_client.disconnect()
```

5. Copy **MQTT Publish code** to **code.py** on your RPi Pico and save. Make sure that PC is configured in same subnet 192.168.1.xxx.



## Step 4: Upload and Run

1. Check COMport in [Device Manager] and then open Serial Terminal.

![][link-port]![][link-terminal]

2. Create broker using mosquitto by executing the following command. If the broker is created normally, the broker's IP address is the current IP of your desktop or laptop, and the port is 1883 by default.

```
mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -p 1883 -v
```

![][link-mqtt_1]

3. If the MQTT publish example works normally on Raspberry Pi Pico, you can see the network information of Raspberry Pi Pico, connecting to the broker and publishing the message.

![][link-mqtt_2]

4. Subscribe to the broker with the above command. Subscribe will receive a message from the broker.

```
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.11 -t WIZnetTest
```

## Appendix

- In Mosquitto versions earlier than 2.0 the default is to allow clients to connect without authentication. In 2.0 and up, you must choose your authentication options explicitly before clients can connect. Therefore, if you are using version 2.0 or later, refer to following link to setup 'mosquitto.conf' in the directory where Mosquitto is installed.
