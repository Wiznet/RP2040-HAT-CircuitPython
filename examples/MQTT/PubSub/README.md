# How to Test MQTT Publish/Subscribe Example

![][link-mqtt]

![][link-mqtt_0]

## Step 1: Prepare Software

> The following serial terminal program is required for **MQTT Publish/Subscribe** test, download and install from below links.

### &#10004;[**Tera Term**][link-tera_term]  or  &#10004; [**Mosquitto**][link-mosquitto]



## Step 2: Prepare hardware

1. Combine WIZnet Ethernet HAT with Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Connect ethernet cable to Ethernet HAT ethernet port.
3. Connect Raspberry Pi Pico to desktop or laptop using 5 pin micro USB cable.



If you use W5100S-EVB-Pico, you can skip '1. Combine...'



## Step 3: Setup MQTT Publish/Subscribe Example

To test the **MQTT Publish/Subscribe example**, minor settings shall be done in code.

1. Setup SPI and Reset pin.

```python
##SPI0
SPI0_SCK = board.GP18
SPI0_TX = board.GP19
SPI0_RX = board.GP16
SPI0_CSn = board.GP17

##reset
W5x00_RSTn = board.GP20
```

2. Initialize ethernet interface with DHCP.

```python
eth = WIZNET5K(spi_bus, cs, is_dhcp=True, mac=MY_MAC, debug=False)
```

3. In the MQTT configuration, the broker IP address is the IP of your desktop.

```python
# Set up a MQTT Client
# NOTE: We'll need to connect insecurely for ethernet configurations.
mqtt_client = MQTT.MQTT(
    broker="192.168.1.11",  #setup your PC IP address.
    username="rpi-pico",       
    password="wiznet",      
    is_ssl=False,
    socket_pool=None,
    ssl_context=None,
    keep_alive=60,
)
```

4. going to use MQTT Pubsub.

```python
#MQTT Subscriber Run
while True:
    mqtt_client.loop()

    #send a new message
    mqtt_client.subscribe(breakfast_sub_topic)
    mqtt_client.subscribe(lunch_sub_topic)
    mqtt_client.subscribe(dinner_sub_topic)

    time.sleep(1)

#Disconnected
print("Disconnecting from %s" % mqtt_client.broker)
mqtt_client.disconnect()
```

5. Copy MQTT Publish/Subscribe code to **code.py** on your RPi Pico and save. Make sure that PC is configured in same subnet 192.168.1.xxx.



## Step 4: Upload and Run

1. Check COMport in [Device Manager] and then open Serial Terminal.

![][link-port]![][link-terminal]

2. Create broker using mosquitto by executing the following command. If the broker is created normally, the broker's IP address is the current IP of your desktop or laptop, and the port is 1883 by default.

```
C:\Program Files\Mosquitto> mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -p 1883 -v
```

![][link-mqtt_1]

3. **Open three Prompt windows** and connect three clients to the broker with the following instructions.

- -h : It means the IP address of the host PC.
- -t : Subscribe from Broker under Topic name.

```
[Client Breakfast]
C:\Program Files\Mosquitto> mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.11 -t BREAKFAST
[Client Lunch]
C:\Program Files\Mosquitto> mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.11 -t LUNCH
[Client Dinner]
C:\Program Files\Mosquitto> mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.11 -t DINNER
```

4. Mosquito broadcasts and the client is connected as follows.

![][link-mqtt_pubsub_2]

5. When you open a new prompt and put a **Public message** in the topic through a broker, the text suitable for each **Topic** is output in response.

```
C:\Program Files\Mosquitto>mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.11 -t breakfast -m "B"

C:\Program Files\Mosquitto>mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.11 -t lunch -m "L"

C:\Program Files\Mosquitto>mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.11 -t dinner -m "D"
```

## Appendix

- In Mosquitto versions earlier than 2.0 the default is to allow clients to connect without authentication. In 2.0 and up, you must choose your authentication options explicitly before clients can connect. Therefore, if you are using version 2.0 or later, refer to following link to setup 'mosquitto.conf' in the directory where Mosquitto is installed.
